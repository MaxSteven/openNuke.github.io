###Intro
Colour correct's the CG beauty using the secondary(aov) passes with a subtractive process.
to be used when:
- the CG is good and only a few passes need adjusting
- the secondaries don't add up to the beauty
includes:
- rgb saturation (luminance mix on)
- rgb contrast (with pivot)
- matting with external mask input or main channel input or both with an operation.
- The order of correction is: Grade Node>Contrast Node>Saturation."
